# Music Genre Classification

- Aim is to create a machine learning model which classifies music samples into different genres.
- It aims to predict the genre by using an audio signal as its input.
- Automating the classification of music helps to make the selection of songs quick and less time-consuming.
- It can also be used to find valuable data such as finding out popular genres, trends, and artists very easily.

## üåê About Dataset?

- We shall be using the GTZAN music classification dataset, which consists of audio files of 30 seconds each with each audio track being in .wav format.
- The dataset contains 10 genres of music:
- Classical, Jazz, Country, Rock, Blues, Reggae, Metal, Disco, Hip-hop, Pop
- [GTZAN Dataset](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html)

## ‚ö°Feature Extraction
- In order to help us extract the features from the audio files, we have used the LibROSA library
- Libros is a library designed for music and audio analysis and helps provides the building blocks necessary in order to create a music retrieval system.
- Libros helps to visualize the audio signals and perform feature extraction using different signal processing techniques.

-  **Signals :**
    - [x] A signal is a variation in a certain quantity over time.

-  **The Fourier Transform  :**
    - [x] An audio signal is comprised of several single-frequency sound waves. When taking samples of the signal over time, we only capture the resulting amplitudes.
    - [x] It converts the signal from the time domain into the frequency domain. The result is called a spectrum.

-  **Zero-Crossing Rate :**
    - [x] The zero-crossing rate is the rate of sign-changes along with a signal, i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back.
